## Development Process

This application was built from scratch following a user-centered design approach:

1. **Planning & Design**: Created wireframes and defined user journey through the learning path
2. **Component Architecture**: Developed reusable components for nodes, modals, and interactive elements
3. **Learning Content**: Structured educational content with progressive difficulty levels
4. **Internationalization**: Implemented multi-language support throughout the application
5. **Gamification**: Added achievement systems and progress tracking to increase engagement
6. **Performance Optimization**: Ensured smooth animations and transitions across devices
7. **Testing & Refinement**: Conducted user testing to improve the learning experience

## Educational Content

The app covers the following topics in AI and LLMs:

1. **Introduction**: Basic concepts and importance of AI in modern technology
2. **Basic Concepts**: Foundations of machine learning and neural networks
3. **Intermediate Level**: Understanding how language models work
4. **Advanced Level**: Deep dive into LLMs like ChatGPT and their applications
5. **Final Challenge**: Comprehensive assessment of AI knowledge
